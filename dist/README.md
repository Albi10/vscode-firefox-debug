# Debug Adapter for Firefox

This package implements the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) for Firefox.
It is part of the [VS Code Debugger for Firefox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firefox-devtools.vscode-firefox-debug) but can be used by other IDEs as well to integrate with Firefox's debugger.
