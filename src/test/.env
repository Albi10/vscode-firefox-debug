# this file defines environment variables used in tests

# this is necessary to run the tests with ts-node
TS_NODE_FILES=true

# optional: set the Firefox executable and profile to be used in the tests
# FIREFOX_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/firefox
# FIREFOX_PROFILE=debug

# the tests can't detect which version of Firefox is used and what features it supports, so we declare the features here:

# the behavior when stepping out of a function changed in Firefox 66
NEW_STEP_OUT_BEHAVIOR=true

# Firefox 66 stopped supporting server-side sourcemaps 
SERVER_SIDE_SOURCEMAPS=false

# the protocol for setting breakpoints changed in Firefox 67
NEW_BREAKPOINT_PROTOCOL=true

# watchpoints support should be introduced in Firefox 70
WATCHPOINTS=false
